## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Applying border on hover over button element was moving the button and it's container slightly, so I found out about applying box-shadow instead of border to the button which gives the same effect without disturbing the layout.
